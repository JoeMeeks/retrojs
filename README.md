# retrojs

This project compiles some libretro projects into nice CommonJS modules using Emscripten.

## Building
To build, you will need to do the following:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/matthewbauer/retrojs.git
cd retrojs
npm install
npm run build
```

## Testing
To run the tests from node:
```
npm test
```

The test file test.html can be loaded in the browser to run after index.js files have been built.

* gambatte
* vba-next
* nestopia
